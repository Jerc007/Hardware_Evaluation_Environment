# Hardware_Evaluation_Environment
The proposed environment supports the implementation of a methodology focuses on the accurate and efficient analysis of fault effects in microarchitectural control units of GPUs, as well as their capacity to propagate, possibly identifying equivalent error effects during the execution of instructions by a parallel application.
