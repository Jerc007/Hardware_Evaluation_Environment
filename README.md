## Description:

The proposed environment supports the implementation of a methodology focuses on the accurate and efficient analysis of fault effects in microarchitectural control
units of GPUs, as well as their capacity to propagate, possibly identifying equivalent error effects during the execution of instructions by a parallel application. The method speeds up
the analysis and evaluation by resorting to the careful structural analysis of the GPU in combination with efficient fine-grain fault characterizations of the units when executing instructions from workloads. 
Then, the fault characterization faces the almost unfeasible evaluation times of complete workloads in a GPU (i.e., the complete operation of an application in a gate-level GPU model) by resorting to localized fault injection campaigns (on the target unit, only) and multi-threading mechanisms to split the workload’s instructions and the faults on individual fault evaluations per instruction. 
A later analysis determines the impact effects at the unit level and also provides the mapping of faults to corresponding feasible instruction errors (i.e., error models) to support accurate cross-layer evaluation.

The environment implements the following three steps of the methodology: **(1)** Instruction’s profiling and unit feature’s extrac-
tion, **(2)** Focused micro-architectural characterization, and **(3)** Error classification and analysis.


## Preliminary and Configuration steps:

The operation of the hardware evaluation framework is focused on the micro-architectural characterization of hardware units inside hardware descriptions of digital devices (specially GPUs).
Thus, a set of preliminary conditions and configurations are required for the correct operation of the environmentm, during the characterization.

Set of preliminary steps:

1)Import the GPU model for evaluation:

The GPU model must be imported in the following path:

```current_folder/user/intruction_level_ers/```

Please, check that line 1710 in *general_launcher.py* is correclty configured.

2) Gate-level generation of each unit
The environment requires the gate-level (verilog) netlist for the fault-injection campaigns. Thus, Design Compiler and a 15nm Technology library are used to generate the gate-level version (see folder intruction_level_ers/GL for examples of generation and the versions used in the experiments).

Once the two previous steps are correctly performed, the profiling, evaluation and classification can be performed. It must be noted that the previous steps are mandatory to adapt the proposed environment to target new hardware units or customize the unit profiling.
If the purpose is to analyze the effect on the target hardware units (e.g., control units in GPUs), the preliminary steps can be skipped.


## Configuration steps of the environment:

The environment is based in the follow files hierarchy:

- parallel/*general_launcher.py*
- instruction_level_ers/TB/target_unit/*gpu_compile.tcl*
- parallel/permanent/target_unit/*launch_zoixs.sh*
- parallel/*fault_analyzer.py*

Other complementary tools:

- parallel/*analyze_use_units.py*
- parallel/*HW_SW_analyzer.py*
- parallel/*instruction_errors_analyzer.py*
- parallel/*multiple_faults_analyzer.py*


The *general_launcher.py* file is the main file of the environment and configures and handles the complete execution of the profiling, fault-injection and error classification tasks.

To execute a the evaluation, the following command is used:

```python3 general_launcher.py target_application target_unit```

where, *target_application* and *target_unit* are the target instructions from a specific application and the target unit for evaluation, respectively.

Three target units (*target_unit*) can be evaluated: *warp_unit*, *decode*, and *fetch*.
Moreover, the instruction from fourteen applications can be evaluated: *back_propagation*, *euler*, *FFT*, *gray_filter*, *mxm*, *mxm_simple*, *nn*, *reduction*, *scalar_vector_product*, *scan*, *sobel*, *sort*, *transpose*, and *vector_add*.

The *gpu_compile.tcl* is mainly used to handle the hardware profiling operation. Moreover, this procedure allows the collection of target information from the instruction's execution per workload.

The *launch_zoixs.sh* handles the configuration and execution of the focused fault simulation campaigns on the hardware units. This step is executed through several sets of multi-threading schemes that are managed by the general controller of the environment (*general_launcher.py*).

The *fault_analyzer.py* is only used after all previous steps finished and associates the intermediate results from the previous steps to identify any possible presence of observable errors.

A set of complementary tools (*analyze_use_units.py*, *HW_SW_analyzer.py*, *instruction_errors_analyzer.py*, and *multiple_faults_analyzer.py*) are used to provide additional metrics and analyses.



## Example of simple analysis and evaluation:

The following example shows the use of the environment to evaluate the instructions from the vector_add application in the fetch unit:

```python3 general_launcher.py vector_add decode```

Once, the simulation and evaluations are finished, you will observe a new folder *parallel/decode/vector_add* containing all the output reports:

- *individual_ins/*

contains the individual reports per dynamic instruction from the application.


- *decode_global_general_structure_execution_errors.txt*
- *decode_global_general_structure_operand_errors.txt*
- *decode_global_general_structure_operation_errors.txt*
- *decode_global_general_structure_order_errors.txt*

contain the set of each fault and the possible error classification.

- *decode_instruction_logger.log*

contains the execution time per dynamic instruction from the golde hardware profiling operation.

- *decode_report_Hw_faults_errors_relation.txt*

contains the quantitative relation of SW errors and HW faults from the performed evaluation.

- *decode_strobe_list.txt*

contains the hardware ports evaluated to identify observable error effects from propagated faults during the fault injection campaigns.

- *general_binary_distribution.txt*

These contain the binary error effects (number of bits affected by the propagated fault) for all propagated faults.

- *general_output_results.txt*

Contains the general output information of the number of faults classified, execution times and general evaluation of the instructions in a hardware unit.

- *individual_bin_distribution_execution_errors.txt*
- *individual_bin_distribution_operand_errors.txt*
- *individual_bin_distribution_operation_errors.txt*
- *individual_bin_distribution_order_errors.txt*

These contain the binary error effects (number of bits affected by the propagated fault) for each visible error classification.

- *inst_classification_execution.txt*
- *inst_classification_operand.txt*
- *inst_classification_operational.txt*
- *inst_classification_order.txt*

These contain the classification of the dynamic instructions into each visible error classification.

- *saf_dic_long.txt* 

contains the fine-grain hardware-level classification of the faults and the main effect at the output.

Other files are use as intermediate-step files for the analyses.
